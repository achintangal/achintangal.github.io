# Moto Troubleshooting 

Currently, troubleshooting an 2001 996 that idles fine but doesn't wanna rev past 4k. 
So, its either a fuelling issue or an ignition/ecu issue. 

Steps done so far:

- Replaced the fuel filter and  fuel-hoses
- Replaced the throttle body hoses
- Reconnected all the sensors and cleaned the contacts
- Checked the battery

Due to the ultimap eprom, Gdiag/IWdiag are not very useful, so will be installing the OEM 996 eprom. 

Pending tasks: 

- Check for faults and sensor errors using the factory eprom via Gdiag/Iwdiag
- Check if both coils are firing (spark check)
- Injectors check (noid lights?)

Parts: 
- Spare coil
- Crank Position Sensor
- O oring for the fuel pump assembly
- Spare fuel filter
- Ducati 996 fuel level sender
